# Kaggle Playground Series Competition, Season 3, Episode 2
Second Episode of Playground Series, Season 3. (Stroke probability prediction)

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance


**Files**<br>
- train.csv - the training dataset; stroke is the binary target
- test.csv - the test dataset; **your objective** is to predict the probability of positive stroke
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
